## How to Use

### Development

Normally you will want to start the development build from the root directory to
build all required core packages at once â€” but in some cases you might want to
build just a specific package.

```bash
yarn start
```

### Build

There is no need to build this package with `tsc` since it is consumed by
importing source files directly:

```bash
import { Button } from '@newrade/core-react-ui';
```

### Test

```bash
yarn test
```
