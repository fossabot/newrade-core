## Pages

Pages are the highest level component available. They are usually configured in
CMS or in config files. Each page can set its own Layout (e.g. how navigation is
layed out) and choose its Template.

The Layout controls how the navigation and content is layed out.

The Template controls SEO / meta properties and how its content is rendered
(e.g. what sections are used).
