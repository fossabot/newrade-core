There are principles and rules that guide the rest of the system. This system
includes the following subjects.

## Brand - üíé

General presentation of our brand, its principles and philosophy.

### Principles

### Design Philosophy

### Identity

### Gallery

## Foundations - üìê

### Colors

> What colors are available to use and how colors should be used.

#### Elevation

### Typography

### Sizing

How to size and space out components and content.

### Iconography

How icons are used in the system.

### Illustrations

How illustrations are used in the system to convey meaning.

### Photography

### Effects

> How shadows, transparency and other special effects are used.

Effects are applied usually used by components, they include:

- Shadows (both outer and inner)
- Text Shadows
- Overlay Effects (transparency)

One way to have consistency between effect is to have predefined effects, e.g. 3
level of box shadow, that components can use, resulting in fewer versions of
those.

### Layout

### Animations

How motion is applied in components and navigation.

## Templates - üì± üíª

Complete website or application designs that implements our design system.

## Patterns - ‚öõÔ∏è

### Navigation

### Search

## Components - üî∂

Components include all UI elements starting from small, undivisible ones like
icons, separators... to more complex ones like buttons, inputs and then, larger
ones like forms, data charts and other high-level components.

This organisation follows the
[Atomic Design Principles](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/)
where smaller components (atoms) compose slightly larger ones (molecules) which
go into even larger and more complete components (organisms).

## Print - üìÑ

## Data Visualization - üìä

### Gallery

### Colors

### Spacing

### Charts

## Design Tokens - üéõÔ∏è

## Content API

Every website or app has to place content (text, images, video, forms, etc) in a
page or a view. As designers and developers we have to think about this for
every project.

The following is an opinionated way of seeing the content we place on pages. We
call this the **Website API**.

Content is organized with [Pages](/design-system/content/pages/),
[Sections](/design-system/content/sections/) and
[Blocks](/design-system/content/blocks/).

## Utilities

## Additional Resources

No design system is made in a vacuum. Here are our recommended reading list,
references and design systems.

there:
