<DocHeader props={props}/>

The main purpose of this section is to present concisely the rules, guidelines
and principles we use in the design system.

> **2022-01:** At this point in time everything here is organized as a technical
> reference. Additional tutorials, how-to guides and explanation content will be
> added at some point.

The documentation for the system is divided in 4 parts:

- Tutorials (_coming soon_)
- How to guides (_coming soon_)
- The technical reference (_available_)
- Explanation and theory (_coming soon_)

### Iconography

How icons are used in the system.

### Photography

### Effects

> How shadows, transparency and other special effects are used.

Effects are applied usually used by components, they include:

- Shadows (both outer and inner)
- Text Shadows
- Overlay Effects (transparency)

One way to have consistency between effect is to have predefined effects, e.g. 3
level of box shadow, that components can use, resulting in fewer versions of
those.

### Layout

### Animations

How motion is applied in components and navigation.

## Components - üî∂

Components include all UI elements starting from small, undivisible ones like
icons, separators... to more complex ones like buttons, inputs and then, larger
ones like forms, data charts and other high-level components.

This organisation follows the
[Atomic Design Principles](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/)
where smaller components (atoms) compose slightly larger ones (molecules) which
go into even larger and more complete components (organisms).

Get started by exploring available components.

## Design Tokens - üéõÔ∏è

## Website API - üç±

Every website or app has to place content (text, images, video, forms, etc) in a
page or a view. As designers and developers we have to think about this for
every project.

The following is an opinionated way of seeing the content we place on pages. We
call this the **Website API**.

Content is organized with [Pages](/design-system/website-api/pages/),
[Sections](/design-system/website-api/sections/) and
[Blocks](/design-system/website-api/blocks/).
