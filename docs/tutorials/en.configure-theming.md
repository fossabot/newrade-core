<DocHeader props={props}/>

Based on the foundations, we have developed a theming system that allows
designers and developers to configure, via simple
[typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) files, every aspects of the design
system.

The file structure follows the design system, there are config files for colors,
effects, typography, layout and so on.

## Default Theme - ⚫️

The default theme is the one that you see when looking at this documentation. It
provide a basic theme with neutral colors, typography choices that are meant for
reading and useful defaults for layout, animation etc.

One can have a look at the default with the following files:

- `default-animations.ts`
- `default-typography.ts`
- `default-colors.ts`

and more... in the
[default theme directory](https://github.com/newrade/newrade/tree/master/packages/core-react-ui/src/design-system).
